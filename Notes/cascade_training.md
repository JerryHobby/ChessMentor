# Cascade Training Document - ChessMentor Project

## Project Overview
ChessMentor is an advanced chess learning and analysis platform being developed with the following specifications:
- Framework: Godot 4.3 Mono
- Language: C# (.NET 6.0)
- Chess Engine: Stockfish 17
- Primary Goal: Create an intuitive, responsive chess learning platform with robust UCI engine integration

## Core Components

### 1. Chess Engine Integration (UciEngine)
- Handles all UCI protocol communication with Stockfish
- Manages engine process lifecycle
- Processes engine commands and responses
- Provides move analysis and evaluation

### 2. Game Management (GameManager)
- Central game state coordinator
- Manages turn-based gameplay
- Coordinates between UI, engine, and game logic
- Maintains game history and state

### 3. Move Processing System
- Validates chess moves according to rules
- Manages piece movement and placement
- Coordinates with engine for computer moves
- Provides move feedback and validation

### 4. Debug System
- Non-invasive logging system
- Categories: UCI, Game, Move, Engine, Debug, Error
- File-based logging with buffering
- Detailed state tracking and diagnostics

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Interface-based design
- Proper use of C# features
- Scalable component structure

### 2. Best Practices
- Comprehensive error handling
- Thorough input validation
- Proper state management
- Clean, maintainable code

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for subsystems
- Comprehensive move validation tests
- Engine communication tests

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Code Structure
- Use interfaces for component contracts
- Implement abstract classes where appropriate
- Follow SOLID principles
- Maintain clear documentation

### 2. State Management
- Clear state transitions
- Proper error recovery
- Comprehensive logging
- Thread-safe operations

### 3. Error Handling
- Specific exception types
- Proper error propagation
- Detailed error logging
- Recovery procedures

## Development Process

### 1. Change Management
- Test changes thoroughly
- Commit working versions
- Document modifications
- Maintain stability

### 2. Documentation
- Update training documents
- Maintain development journal
- Document architectural decisions
- Track lessons learned

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Code review standards
- Testing requirements
- Performance metrics
- Stability criteria

## Current Status
- Basic chess game implementation
- UCI engine integration
- Move validation system
- Need architectural improvements

## Next Steps
1. Restore to last working version
2. Document current architecture
3. Plan improvements
4. Implement changes systematically
