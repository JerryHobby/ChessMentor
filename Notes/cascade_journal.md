## Technical Hurdles and Solutions

### November 16, 2024 - Evening Session

#### Challenge 1: Move Validation and Visual Feedback
**Problem**: Pieces weren't snapping to their new positions immediately, causing a poor user experience.
**Root Cause**: Move validation was happening before visual updates, and engine analysis was blocking the UI.
**Solution Process**:
1. USER identified the issue through testing
2. AI analyzed the code and logs
3. Collaboratively identified that we needed to:
   - Separate visual updates from move validation
   - Make engine analysis asynchronous
   - Use proper state tracking
4. Implemented solution in stages:
   - Added immediate visual piece placement
   - Created async CompleteMove method
   - Added frame waiting for visual updates
**Time Saved**: Estimated 2-3 hours compared to manual debugging and implementation
**Key Learning**: Importance of separating visual feedback from game logic

#### Challenge 2: Engine Communication Race Conditions
**Problem**: Engine was sometimes processing moves multiple times or missing responses.
**Root Cause**: Lack of proper state tracking in engine communication.
**Solution Process**:
1. USER reported duplicate move processing
2. AI analyzed logs and identified patterns
3. Together we:
   - Added isThinking flag
   - Improved timeout handling
   - Added better error checking
4. Iteratively tested and refined
**Time Saved**: Estimated 3-4 hours of debugging time
**Key Learning**: Importance of comprehensive state tracking in async operations

#### Challenge 3: Move Origin Tracking
**Problem**: Moves were being calculated from wrong positions after piece movement.
**Root Cause**: Using current piece position instead of original position for move calculation.
**Solution Process**:
1. USER identified incorrect move notation in logs
2. AI analyzed the move processing flow
3. Together we:
   - Added originalPosition tracking
   - Fixed position conversion methods
   - Improved move validation
4. Tested with various move scenarios
**Time Saved**: Estimated 1-2 hours of debugging time
**Key Learning**: Importance of maintaining source state in drag-and-drop operations

## Collaboration Patterns

### Effective Problem-Solving Flow
